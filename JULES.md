# Jules's Task List for AiOS

This file is used by me, Jules, to track the development progress of the AiOS project. I will keep this file updated as I complete tasks.

## To Do

- [ ] **Testing and Security:** Rigorously test the system for stability, performance, and security vulnerabilities.

## In Progress

- [ ] **Implement App Lifecycle Management:** Give the AI the ability to see and manage the apps it has created.
    - [ ] Create `deleteapp` command.

## Done

- [x] **Initial App Capabilities:** Focus on implementing the first set of app generation capabilities, such as a simple WiFi texting app and a basic web browser.
    - [x] **Implement Initial Networking**
        - [x] Add Internet permission to Manifest.
        - [x] Create `NetworkManager` service.
        - [x] Create `fetch` command.
- [x] **Develop the App Generation Engine:** Build the core functionality that allows the AI to write, compile, and install new applications based on user prompts.
    - [x] Create `FileGenerator.java` utility.
    - [x] Define app templates.
    - [x] Upgrade `createapp` command to generate files.
    - [x] **Implement App Template System**
        - [x] Create template files and directory structure.
        - [x] Create `TemplateManager` service.
        - [x] Create `listtemplates` command.
        - [x] Upgrade `createapp` command to use templates.
- [x] **Implement App Awareness and Management:** Give the AI the ability to see and manage the apps it has created.
    - [x] Create `AppInfo.java` model and `AppRegistry.java` service.
    - [x] Integrate `AppRegistry` into `AiOSCore`.
    - [x] Create `listapps` command.
    - [x] Upgrade `createapp` command to update the registry.
- [x] **Create Project Documentation:** Write technical documentation for the project's architecture and API.
- [x] **Implement Self-Monitoring (System Status Self-Stream):** Give the AI the ability to see and understand its own processes and the device's status.
- [x] **Develop the Core AI:** Build and train the foundational AI model that will be at the heart of AiOS.
  - [x] Create `Message.java` Model.
  - [x] Create Placeholder `AiService.java`.
  - [x] Integrate AI Service with MainActivity.
  - [x] Implement basic command parser.
  - [x] **Implement Core AI Memory and Modular Architecture**
    - [x] Create `AiOSCore.java` (AI Memory).
    - [x] Implement `Command` pattern (Interface, Registry, Command classes).
    - [x] Refactor `AiService` to use the Command Registry.
- [x] **UI/UX:** Design an intuitive user interface for interacting with the AI.
  - [x] Design the main chat interface.
  - [x] Implement basic UI logic.
- [x] **Android Integration:** Create the Android application that will host the AI and serve as the operating system layer.
  - [x] Set up Android Project Structure (the "housing").
  - [x] Create a basic Main Activity.
  - [x] Build and verify the skeleton app.

## Future Recommendations

This section outlines potential next steps and long-term goals for the AiOS project.

-   **Dynamic Template Arguments:**
    -   Enhance the `createapp` command to pass arguments to templates.
    -   Example: `createapp MyBrowser simplebrowser --homepage=https://jules.example.com`
    -   This would involve adding a placeholder like `__HOMEPAGE__` to the `SimpleBrowserApp` template and replacing it during generation.

-   **New App Templates:**
    -   Create new templates for more complex applications, such as:
        -   `SimpleTextApp`: A basic UI for a future messaging app.
        -   `NoteTakerApp`: A simple app for writing and saving text notes.

-   **App Compilation & Installation:**
    -   Implement a system to actually build the generated app source code into an APK file.
    -   Explore methods for legally and securely installing the generated APK on the device. This is a major security consideration and would require user permission.

-   **Advanced Self-Monitoring:**
    -   Upgrade the `SystemMonitor` to report on real device metrics instead of simulated ones.
    -   Examples: CPU usage, memory usage, network status, battery level.

-   **True AI Integration:**
    -   Replace the current command-based `AiService` with a real on-device Machine Learning model.
    -   This would enable more natural language understanding and interaction, moving closer to the project's ultimate vision.
