# AiOS: An AI-Powered, Self-Hosted Mobile Operating System

**Author:** Rees Farrington

## 1. Vision

AiOS is a revolutionary new operating system for Android devices. It features a self-hosted AI that acts as the core of the OS. This AI is not just a passive assistant; it's a proactive partner that can observe its own processes and activities in real-time. The ultimate goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience where you can create new applications and functionalities on-the-fly using simple text or voice commands.

## 2. Core Features

*   **Self-Hosted AI:** The entire AI runs locally on your device, ensuring privacy and offline functionality.
*   **Real-Time Self-Awareness:** The AI has the unique ability to monitor its own internal processes and system activities, allowing for advanced optimization and security.
*   **On-Demand App Creation:** Generate new, custom applications simply by describing what you want. The AI will handle the coding, testing, and security verification.
*   **Wide Range of Capabilities:** Create a variety of useful apps, including:
    *   WiFi-based text and voice calling apps.
    *   Custom web browsers.
    *   Games and entertainment apps.
    *   Productivity tools.
*   **Legal and Secure:** All generated applications are designed to be legally compliant and secure, with the AI ensuring that best practices are followed.

## 3. Current Status (v0.6)

The project is under active development. As of the current version, the AI has the following capabilities:

*   **Modular Command System:** The AI's abilities are built on a flexible command-registry pattern, making it easy to add new skills.
*   **Self-Awareness:** The AI has a core "memory" (`AiOSCore`) and an `AppRegistry`, allowing it to be aware of the applications it has created. It can list these apps with the `listapps` command.
*   **Proactive Monitoring:** A `SystemMonitor` service runs in the background, providing a continuous "self-stream" of status updates to the UI.
*   **App Generation Engine:** The AI can generate complete, functional Android applications from a library of templates. It currently knows how to build a "HelloWorldApp" and a "SimpleBrowserApp".

## 4. Project Roadmap

This project aims to create a fully functional proof-of-concept of the AiOS. The high-level plan is as follows:

1.  **Implement Initial Networking Capabilities:** Give the AI the ability to connect to the internet to fetch information and communicate. This is the foundation for future skills.
2.  **Advanced App Capabilities:** Expand the app generation engine to support more complex applications, such as:
    *   WiFi-based text and voice calling apps.
    *   More advanced browsers with tabs and history.
    *   Simple games and productivity tools.
3.  **True Self-Awareness:** Enhance the `SystemMonitor` to provide real-time data about the device's actual processes, memory, and network status.
4.  **Security and Sandboxing:** Develop robust security protocols and a sandboxed environment for testing and running generated applications safely.
5.  **Core AI Enhancement:** Replace the placeholder AI logic with a more advanced, possibly on-device, machine learning model for more natural language understanding and interaction.

## 5. How It Works (Conceptual)

The user interacts with AiOS through a simple prompt-based interface (text or voice). For example, a user could say:

> "Create an app that lets me make free calls over WiFi."

The AiOS would then:
1.  Parse and understand the request.
2.  Design the application, considering all necessary features and security measures.
3.  Write the code for the new app.
4.  Compile and test the app in a sandboxed environment.
5.  If the app passes all checks, it will be installed and made available to the user.
6.  The AI will confirm with a message like: "Your new WiFi calling app has been coded, tested, and is ready to use."

This project is ambitious, but it has the potential to redefine how we interact with our mobile devices.
